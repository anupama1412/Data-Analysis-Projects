# Data-Analysis-Projects

This repository contains data analysis projects using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Below are details of the projects included:

## 1. Analyzing 911 Calls
This project dives into analyzing emergency 911 calls data. It explores various aspects such as common reasons for a call, most frequent areas, etc. It also involves converting time column to DateTime object to extract useful information like date, day of week, etc, cleaning null values from the data and data visualization using Countplots, Heatmaps and Clustermaps.

### Files
- `Analysing_911_calls_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code.
- `911.csv`: Dataset used for analysis

## 2. Zomato Orders Analysis
The Zomato Orders Analysis project focuses on understanding customer behavior and preferences through Zomato orders data. It includes cleaning the data by removing unwanted values and expressions, filling null values with mean of the column and visualizations and statistical analysis using bar graphs and pie charts to uncover patterns and trends.

### Files
